Simple custom gun plugin for Bukkit on Minecraft (MCv1.9).

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/gunsmith.189617/

Simple custom gun Bukkit plugin for Minecraft. Simply hold the item corresponding to the gun, and right click to fire.

Type "/gun <gunName>" to get a gun. Gun Names:

    "sniper" for a Sniper Rifle (base item: feather)
    "br" for a Battle Rifle (base item: wood hoe)
    "lmg" for a Light Machine Gun (base item: diamond pickaxe)
    "pistol" for a Pistol (base item: gold axe)

GunSmith works best with a custom resource pack that displays the base items as the corresponding firearm. A specialty resource pack may be added in the near future to facilitate players and servers using this plugin.

Guides & plugin to be updated consistently! This plugin is far from complete, and represents an open-source, work-in-progress project.
