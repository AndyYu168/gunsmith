Simple custom gun plugin for Bukkit on Minecraft (MCv1.9).

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/gunsmith.189617/

Simple custom gun Bukkit plugin for Minecraft. Simply hold the item corresponding to the gun, and right click to fire. You will need the proper ammunition to fire a weapon, as well!

GunSmith works best with a custom resource pack that displays the base items as the corresponding firearm. A specialty resource pack is included in our GitHub project repository, and can be directly downloaded here: https://github.com/randallarms/gunsmith/raw/master/resources/GunSmith%20%5BResources%5D.zip

Type "/giveGun <gunName>" to get a gun. Gun Names:

    "sniper" for a Sniper Rifle (base item: feather)
    "br" for a Battle Rifle (base item: wood hoe)
    "lmg" for a Light Machine Gun (base item: diamond pickaxe)
    "pistol" for a Pistol (base item: gold axe)
    "bow" for a Crossbow (base item: flint)
    "shotgun" for a Shotgun (base: gold shovel)
    "ar" for an Assault Rifle (base: wood pickaxe)
    "hmg" for a Heavy Machine Gun (base: gold pickaxe)

Type "/giveAmmo <gunName>" to get the corresponding ammunition for that gun (crossbows use bolts).
