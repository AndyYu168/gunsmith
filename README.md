#GunSmith

Simple custom gun plugin for Bukkit on Minecraft (MCv1.9).

HOW TO INSTALL AND USE: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/gunsmith.189617/

GunSmith allows players to use certain in-game items as guns, firing them with the right-click button when the gun item is held in the main hand.

Currently features the Sniper Rifle (item: feather), Battle Rifle (item: wooden_hoe), and Pistol (golden_axe). To be added: SMGs, shotguns, and rocket launchers.

GunSmith works best with a custom resource pack that displays the base items as the corresponding firearm. A specialty resource pack may be added in the near future to facilitate players and servers using this plugin.
